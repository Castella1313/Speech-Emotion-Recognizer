# Speech-Emotion-Recognizer
In this project, we attempt to detect underlying emotions such as 
(sad, happy, neutral, angry, disgust, surprised, fearful and calm) in recorded speech by analysing the acoustic features 
of the audio data of recordings and 
Create an application to implement the same on user input.
